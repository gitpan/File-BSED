.SH NAME
isedbin - binary stream editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B isedbin
[-vsw] [-m [min-]max] search=replace infile outfile
.br
.B isedbin
[-vsw] [-m [min-]max] search infile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isedbin
searches for a binary string in a file.  If a replace string is given,
.B isedbin
copies infile to outfile, replacing all instances of the search string
with the replace string.
.P
If infile is '-', input is from standard input; if outfile is '-',
output is to standard output.
.P
Both the search and the replace strings can contain a combination of
ascii characters and hex numbers. The following is the algorithm used:
If the string begins with a digit (0-9), assume a hex number is 
beginning.  Continue converting hex digits (0-f) into binary
until a non-hex digit begins, unless the string began with
"0x" or "0x": in that case just throw away the 0x.  Every
2 hex digits makes a byte; if there is an odd number then
the last digit is taken as the low nibble of a byte.  Anytime
a backslash (\) is encountered, consider it to be a break
in the conversion process and treat it as if starting a new
string.  If another backslash is immediately following it,
insert a backslash.  Once converting an ascii string, continue
converting it until a backslash or end of string.
.P
NOTE: be sure to escape the backslash from the shell.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v" 5
verbose option.  First lists the search (and replace) string in a
hex-ascii dump format:  each byte is listed first in hex, followed
by the ascii for each printable character or "." for each non-printing
character.  Next it gives a hex-ascii dump of the context of each
match of the search string, with the position of the match into
the file (in hex) in the middle of the dump.
Output is to stderr.
.IP "-s" 5
Normally 
.B isedbin
will list the number of matches to stderr.  This option suppresses that.
.IP "-w" 5
Normally
.B isedbin
will warn if the search and replace strings are not the same length.
This option suppresses that warning.
.IP "-m [min-]max" 5
Normally
.B isedbin
will find all the matches of the search string.  This option specifies
a range of match numbers to use.  The default mininimum is number 1.
Both min and max are in decimal.
