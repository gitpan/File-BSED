The bsedlib code bundled with this library is a hacked version
of bsed to make the code reusable to work as a library. 
bsedlib was hacked together by the author of File::BSED, but the 
original author of bsed is Dave Dykstra <dwdbsed@drdykstra.us>, you can
find more information on bsed here: http://www.bell-labs.com/wwexptools/bsed/
