NAME
    File::BSED - Search/Replace in Binary Files.

VERSION
    This document describes File::BSED version 0.4

SYNOPSIS
        use File::BSED qw(bsed binary_files_matches);

        # search/replace
        my $matches = bsed({
            search  => 'ff3cea3f0013',
            replace => 'b801000000c3',
            infile  => '/bin/ls',
            outfile => '/tmp/ls.patched'
        });
        if ($matches == -1) {
            my $error_string = File::BSED->errtostr();
            die "Error: $error_string\n";
        }
        print "Replaced $matches time(s)\n";

        # search
        my $matches = binary_files_matches('ff3cea3f0013', '/bin/ls');
        print "Matched $matches time(s)\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a perl-binding to "bsedlib", which is a library version of
    "bsed", the binary stream editor.

    "bsed" lets you search and replace binary data in binary files by using
    hex values in text strings as search patterns. You can also use wildcard
    matches with "??", which will match any wide byte.

    These are all valid search strings:

        search => "0xffc300193ab2f63a";
        search => "0xff??00??3ab2f??a";
        search => "FF??00??3AB2F??A";

    while these are not:

        search => "the quick brown fox"; # only hex, no text. you would have to
                                         # convert the text to hex first.
        search => "0xff?c33ab3?accc";    # no nybbles only wide bytes. (?? not ?).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  CLASS METHODS
   "bsed(\%arguments)"
    Search and replace in a binary file. Valid arguments are:

    search
        The pattern to search for. Must be a string with hex digits.

    replace
        What to replace with. Must be a string with hex digits. (Probably a
        very good idea that it is the same length as the search pattern).

    infile
        The filename of the file to search in.

    outfile
        The filename of the file to save changes to.

    minmatch
        Need at least $minmatch matches before any work.

    maxmatch
        Stop after $maxmatch matches.

    "bsed" returns the number of times the search string was found in the
    file, or -1 if an error occurred. When an error occurs the error number
    can be found with "errno" and you can get a description of the error
    with "errtostr".

    Example:

        my $number_of_matches = bsed({
            search  => '0xff',
            replace => '0x00',
            
        infile  => '/bin/ls',
            outfile => '/bin/ls.patched',
        });

        if ($number_of_matches = -1) {
            die sprintf("ERROR: %s\n", File::BSED->errtostr());
        }
        print "Replaced $number_of_matches time(s).\n";

  ERROR HANDLING
   "binary_file_matches($search_pattern, $input_file)"
    Return the number of times $search_pattern is found in binary file.
    Search pattern must be a string of hex digits.

    Example:

        my $number_of_matches = binary_file_matches('0xfeedface', '/bin/ls');
        print "Matched $number_of_matches time(s)\n";

   "errtostr"
    This function returns a string describing what happened. if an error has
    occured with either "bsed" or "binary_file_matches" (they return -1 on
    error).

   "errno"
    This function returns the error number if an error has occured with
    either "bsed" or "binary_file_matches" (they return -1 on error).

    Use "errtostr" instead.
