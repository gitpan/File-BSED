Revision history for Perl extension File-BSED.

0.67 Tue Aug 14 16:19:34 2007
    - Now skips author tests. Author test modules removed from dependencies.

0.6  Tue Jul 17 17:23:02 2007
    - uses new version of libgbsed (0.6)
      this means that now the output file will preserve the executable flags
      from the input file.
    - fixed a broken preprocessor directive when PERL_MALLOC was active
      in libgbsed.h
    - removed unused function _hexstr2bin from BSED.xs
    - tried to use goto() for some of the aliases in lib/File/BSED.pm, but
      this obviosly didn't work very well. Reset to function calls instead.

0.5  Sun Jul 15 22:38:45 2007
    - uses new version of libgbsed.

0.4  Fri Jul 13 17:33:09 2007

    - Changed Dave Dykstra's email from dwd@bell-labs.com to

      and made our tests fail.
    - Minor documentation changes.
